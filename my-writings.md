This space is where I share my thoughts on software engineering, technical leadership, and building strong team cultures. I’ve been an avid reader for years, learning from books, articles, and the insights of people I follow in the engineering community. Writing is my way of reflecting, learning openly, and giving back. These posts are just the beginning — I hope to grow this into a meaningful body of work over time.

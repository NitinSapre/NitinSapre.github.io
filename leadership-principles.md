## How I lead

My goal as an Engineering Manager is to create an environment where teams can reliably ship scalable products, feel ownership of what they build, and grow in their careers while we solve real customer problems.

## Principles

### 1. People first, always
- Invest in coaching, feedback, and clear growth paths.
- Create a psychologically safe environment where engineers can raise risks early and learn from mistakes.

### 2. Clarity of goals and ownership
- Make sure teams understand the “why” behind the work, not just the “what”.
- Encourage end-to-end ownership of services and features, from design to production operations.

### 3. Pragmatic, scalable architecture
- Prefer simple, well-understood designs that can evolve over time.
- Use microservices, event-driven patterns, and cloud platforms where they add real value, not just for trend’s sake.

### 4. Data-driven delivery
- Align work with measurable outcomes: reliability, performance, customer impact, and business value.
- Use metrics, dashboards, and feedback loops to guide decisions and iterate.

### 5. Strong partnership with stakeholders
- Act as a trusted technical partner to product, business, and customers—translating needs into realistic, high-quality solutions.
- Communicate trade-offs and timelines transparently, especially when managing complexity and risk.

### 6. Continuous improvement
- Treat incidents and challenges as opportunities to improve systems, processes, and skills.
- Encourage experimentation, learning, and regular retrospectives to keep raising the bar.
